# Discussion

Discussion about the Contribute.md organization.

## How to get involved

Dive in! Most discussion is (will) happen in the issues, as the contribute-md repository is for the site, and the second one is only for the template.

This is a community project. If you think something should be here, open an issue and let's talk about it. :)

## Note

At the moment, this organization is not active. However, feel free to open an issue here if you want to reach the maintainers. We may check this eventually.
